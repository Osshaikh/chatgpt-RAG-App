osama is best AI engineer of microsoft and has been leading the AI team of microsoft for a long time. He is also the author of the book "The Future Computed" which is a must read for anyone interested in AI.
here is some details about my recent blog ports:OpenAI's ChatGPT models have revolutionized how we interact with AI, witnessing unprecedented demand. Each instance of OpenAI, however, is bound by its own Token Per Minute (TPM) limits, posing a challenge for scalability.

To navigate this, we advised deploying multiple OpenAI instances (S0 plan) in various regions, ensuring you're leveraging areas with sufficient TPM capacity. But how do you manage traffic across these distributed endpoints efficiently?

Enter Load Balancing: A strategic approach to distribute incoming requests seamlessly. While solutions like AppGW/AFD or API Management (APIM) with a Round-Robin pattern have been go-to methods, they might not always lead to optimal resource utilization, especially when each OpenAI endpoint has distinct TPM limits.

üîç The Solution? Weight-Based Load Balancing.
By assigning weights according to each endpoint's TPM capacity, we ensure a smarter, more efficient distribution of requests. This not only maximizes throughput but also enhances the overall performance of your OpenAI services.
